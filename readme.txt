DESCRIPTION:
This Repository has two python files. One is to convert a folder of images to grayscale another one is to resize and convert the images to grayscale.
grey.py - This file converts images to Grayscale ONLY.
The “path” is actually the folder location which is in the “Working Directory”. “Working Directory” address can be seen on the top-right side of the Spyder window. Here “gatto” is a folder name that consist of images and the resized images are also being stored in “gatto” folder.

resizedGray.py - This file changes the resolution to 100/100 and then converts the images to black & white. 
Here also similar method was used and the folder in which I was working was "elefante".

Overall it is working Fine
